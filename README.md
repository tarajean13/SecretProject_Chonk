# Chonkus Positivity Posting Project
The "Chonkus Positivity Project"  aims run an awareness campaign for Chonkus by identifying a target post on Twitter and commenting with postive Chonkus messaging. The goal of Chonkus Coin is to be a memecoin with purposeful utility. Using decentralized science (DeSci), weâ€™ve created a coin that blends memes, synthetic biology, and AI to tackle climate change. The current target is posts relating to DeSci, Memecoins, Algae, Biotechnology and AI. Participants use a spare Twitter account to post a single comment per day with the format "(your text) + (Related Emoji, e.g.,ðŸ¦ )".

# Participation Requirements
1. Volunteer a spare Twitter account for trolling.
2. Ensure your volunteer Twitter account has passed the verification process.

Note: The rewards for this task currently have no liquidity, but will within approximately a month. 

# The Koii Network
The Koii Network empowers users by making their computers work for them when not used. Users (AKA nodes) are rewarded for running tasks they choose on their devices.

To use the code and modify it, the best approach is to go through the first EZsandbox exercise.

1. EZsandbox: To understand the Koii Network better, please go through the EZsandbox - it's beautifully written and gets you through the basics. EZsandbox https://github.com/koii-network/ezsandbox/blob/main/README.md
2. Koii Network Documentation: For further understanding, refer to the Koii Network documentatiom https://www.koii.network/docs

# How to Read Through the Code
The project has two main structures:
1. Twitter Logic: Includes adapters for negotiating session login and commenting.
2. Koii Logic: Managed by coreLogic.js, covering tasks, submissions, audits, and distributions.

Key Files and Modules
CoreLogic.js: Main file directing all operations in the project.
adapters/twitter: Adapter for interacting with the Twitter using puppeteer.
